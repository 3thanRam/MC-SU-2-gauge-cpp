Monte Carlo Study of quantized SU(2) gauge theory

Evaluation of path integrals for pure SU(2) gauge fields using Monte Carlo techniques. Study of the effect of changing: number of iterations, lattice size N, inverse temperature Beta/B ,square wilson loop sizes

Graph 1: Average plaquette as a function of number of iterations for fixed Beta and several lattice sizes

Graph 2: Average plaquette as a function of number of iterations for several Beta for fixed lattice size

Graph 3: Wilson loop as a function of Lattice size for different loop sizes and fixed Beta

Graph 4: Wilson loop as a function of Beta for different loop sizes and fixed lattice size
