# Monte Carlo pure SU(2) lattice gauge field in C++

WIP(incorrect results)

[For those more comfortable with python](https://github.com/3thanRam/MC-pure-SU-2-lattice-gauge)

Calculations based on M.Creutz Phys Rev D article published in Physical review D, 21,(15/04/1980):

Monte Carlo Study of quantized SU(2) gauge theory

Evaluation of path integrals for pure SU(2) gauge fields using Monte Carlo techniques
Study of the effect of changing: number of iterations, lattice size N, inverse temperature Beta/B ,square wilson loop sizes

Figure 1: Average plaquette as a function of number of iterations for fixed Beta and several lattice sizes

Figure 2: Average plaquette as a function of number of iterations for several Beta for fixed lattice size

Figure 3: Wilson loop as a function of Lattice size for different loop sizes and fixed Beta

Figure 4: Wilson loop as a function of Beta for different loop sizes and fixed lattice size
